Check out the [website](https://olincollege.github.io/music-rhythm-game/) for a more in-depth introduction.

# Introduction:

Welcome to catJAM, a call-and-response rhythm game mimicking Dance Dance Revolution with the most *adorable* cats on the planet. Implemented in Python 3, it features original art and an original soundtrack. Jam on!

In this game, you represent a band of cats, seeking to take down your arch-enemies in a legendary battle of the bands. They'll start by playing something, and then it'll be your turn to do it better than the computer!

# Dependencies:

Before you can jam along with the rest of us cool-cats, you'll need to install pygame.

`pip install pygame`

The rest should be taken care of with internal logic and the python standard library (e.g. random,sys).

# Getting it on your computer:

After forking this repository, go ahead and cd into scripts and run `python main.py`. 

At this point, you'll see a menu screen. Whenever you're ready, press **space!**

The computer will play first, showing you what arrows are going to come for you. After 8 beats, it'll be your turn to showcase what you're capable of. Then the computer will play again, and so on Press the arrows keys on beat with the song! You'll receive a score at the end.
