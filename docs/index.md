# Introduction:

Welcome to catJAM, a call-and-response rhythm game mimicking Dance Dance Revolution with the *most* adorable cats on the planet. Implemented in Python 3, it features original art and an original soundtrack. Jam on!

# Dependencies:

Before you can jam along with the rest of us cool-cats, you'll need to install pygame.

`pip install pygame`

The rest should be taken care of with internal logic and the python standard library (e.g. random,sys).

# How to use:

After forking this repository, go ahead and cd into scripts and run `python main.py`. 

At this point, you'll see a menu screen. Whenever you're ready, press **space!**

The computer will play first, showing you what arrows are going to come for you. After 8 beats, it'll be your turn to showcase what you're capable of.
