# Introduction:

Welcome to catJAM, a call-and-response rhythm game mimicking Dance Dance Revolution with the most *adorable* cats on the planet. Implemented in Python 3, it features original art and an original soundtrack. Jam on!

In this game, you represent a band of cats, seeking to take down your arch-enemies in a legendary battle of the bands. They'll start by playing something, and then it'll be your turn to do it better than the computer!

# Dependencies:

Before you can jam along with the rest of us cool-cats, you'll need to install pygame.

`pip install pygame`

The rest should be taken care of with internal logic and the python standard library (e.g. random,sys).

# Getting it on your computer:

After forking this repository, go ahead and cd into scripts and run `python main.py`. 

At this point, you'll see a menu screen. Whenever you're ready, press **space!**

The computer will play first, showing you what arrows are going to come for you. After 8 beats, it'll be your turn to showcase what you're capable of.

Richard loves music, coding, and spending 5 hours changing numbers back and forth in order to compensate for pygame's internal latency. Fun :) 

Madie Tong (Olin '25):

Meow. Madie likes cats, music, and games. That's why we're creating this game :) it all started with a vision from yours truly. now we're suffering. sorry guys, should've chosen something slightly easier.

Isabel de Luis (Olin '25):

Isa loves cats (her greatest shame is that she's allergic to them), coding, and wrangling pygame issues. She's happy with the way the game turned out and thinks the team is pretty awesome :)
