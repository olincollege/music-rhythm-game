TODO:

Madie:
- Working on implementing a player version of the arrows
- Finish drawing the cats
- Animate the cats

Isa:
- Getting code to run on her computer
- Getting the arrow shit the bar on the beat instead of being initialized on the beat.

Richard:
- Continue working on integration with game loop + keep others in the loop with how that's going. 
- Timing the scene transitions
- Design a tutorial melody [Minimal priority]
NOTES:
- The background is actually kind of distracting. Maybe just black instead of all the lights?
- Arrows start on the second beat, not immediately?


NEXT TEAM MEETING - May 6



Anyone:
- Design a menu screen. [Minimal priority]
