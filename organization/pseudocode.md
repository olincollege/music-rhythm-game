On start--
1. A beat should start playing that is looped -- layer a melody on top (done in python, not logic)
2. Background should appear
3. Create an arrow object (could be a sprite)
    - A sprite connected to an image of an arrow
    - A way to indicate whether the arrow is facing up, down, left or right
4. Create the transparent arrow row at the top.


Create the AI that will always perfectly tap the arrows.
